# Ontokentrikos – Object-Oriented Programming Coursework

This repository contains coursework from the **second-semester course  
"Ontokentrikos Programmatismos" (Object-Oriented Programming)**  
at the **Computer Engineering and Informatics Department (CEID), University of Patras**.

The material is organized into three main lab sets and one project  
(Java / C++), implemented during my early studies.

## 📚 Contents

### 1. Java Lab Set 1

**Focus:**  
- Basic Java syntax  
- Command-line arguments  
- Conditional statements and control flow  
- Introduction to classes and objects  

Location: `labs/java-set-1/`

---

### 2. Java Lab Set 2

**Focus:**  
- Classes, inheritance and polymorphism  
- Abstract classes and method overriding  
- Collections (`ArrayList`, iterators, generics)  
- Exception handling and custom exceptions  
- File I/O (reading/writing text and binary files)   

Location: `labs/java-set-2/`

---

### 3. C++ Lab Set 3

**Focus:**  
- Basic C++ syntax and I/O  
- Arrays and multidimensional arrays  
- Classes, constructors, access specifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`)  
- Operator overloading  
- Inheritance and virtual functions  
- STL `vector` and iterators   

Location: `labs/cpp-set-3/`

### 4. Project (to be added)

The course also included a final project implemented in **Java**  
(you could optionally choose C++).  
My implementation was done in Java and you will find it in the folder:

`project/java/`

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

This repository is mainly intended to:

- Document my early object-oriented programming experience in **Java** and **C++**  
- Demonstrate basic understanding of:
  - Class design and encapsulation  
  - Inheritance and polymorphism  
  - Exception handling and file I/O  
  - C++ OOP and STL usage  
- Serve as a **reference** for my own progress and for anyone interested  
  in how I approached these university assignments.

Some parts of the repository come directly from lab exercises and homework  
and reflect my level of understanding during the **2nd semester** of my studies.
